\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Defines the \mbox{\hyperlink{classUtility}{Utility}} class, an abstract base class for utility buildings. 

The \mbox{\hyperlink{classUtility}{Utility}} class represents a type of building that provides essential services to a city, such as power, water, sewage, etc. It extends the \mbox{\hyperlink{classBuilding}{Building}} class and defines common behaviors and attributes for all utility buildings.
